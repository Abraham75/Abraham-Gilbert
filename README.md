## üß† Extended Executive Summary

I am a multidisciplinary AI Product Manager and Semantic Systems Architect with 15+ years of global experience designing intelligent software systems across **healthcare**, **public sector**, **clinical NLP**, and **enterprise AI platforms**. My work integrates **ontological engineering**, **natural language processing**, and **cloud-scale data architectures** to build scalable, ethical, explainable AI products.

From **federated knowledge graphs** to **zero-click conversational agents** for Medicare Advantage plans, my portfolio bridges fragmented health, regulatory, and enterprise data into AI-augmented decision tools‚Äîused by federal agencies, global payers, and Fortune 100 innovators. I thrive at the intersection of **symbolic intelligence**, **ML engineering**, and **product strategy**, ensuring alignment between algorithmic design, compliance standards (HIPAA, HITRUST), and measurable business impact.

## üß≠ Product Management Focus

### What I Bring to an AI PM Role:

- **Technical Fluency**: I speak Python and product fluently‚Äîable to prototype features, collaborate with data science teams, and define AI/ML pipelines hands-on.
- **Semantic Architecture**: I lead ontology-backed product development, using RDF/SHACL/SPARQL to govern AI workflows, semantic search, and regulatory mappings.
- **Conversational AI Leadership**: Designed multilingual triage bots, claims adjudication agents, and CMS-aligned patient guidance tools across payer ecosystems.
- **Cross-functional Alignment**: Built roadmaps in partnership with engineering, design, legal, clinical SMEs, and cloud architects to deliver on OKRs, CMS STAR metrics, and GTM timelines.
